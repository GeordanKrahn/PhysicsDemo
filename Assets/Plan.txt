1: Get Vector Position for the target
    This will simplify the calculations as it would require more
    to calculate force at a spawning point 
2: Calculate force required to launch projectile to coordinates
    Normalize the vector. Calculate force (projectile motion)
    Normalize the x and z axes, Then use the 2D calculation
3: Quaternion rotate the cannon to direction of force
    Create a quaternion to represent our desired rotation.
    Use unity physics to apply the rotation
4: Spawn Projectile and Apply force.
    The projectile will use trigger collision to pass through objects.
    Must have a rigidbody to simulate gravity

Note: we can perform the calculation using the Physics engine, 
        then use unity physics to take the calculations and 
        apply the rotation and force.

In The CannonController script:
    The CannonController will have a 

        public ListOfTargets - complete
        private NextTarget - complete
        private state - complete

    Create a state machine to control the cannon
    The cannon will have the following states:
        
        1 WaitForTarget - complete
            Listen for input
            If input is found
                Go to next state
        2 GetTargetPosition - complete
            Use the NextTarget property of the ListOfTargets
                this removes the first target in the list and then returns it
                if the target is null, 
                    go back to WaitForTarget
                else
                    go to next state 
        3 CalculateForce
            With the position of the target found, calculate the necessary force to hit the target
            The calculation will be done using MathPhysicsEngine
                Go to the next state
        4 ApplyRotation
            Create a quaternion from the direction using MathPhysicsEngine
            Rotate to face in Force Direction.
            After the rotation has finished
                Go to the next state
        5 Shoot - complete
            Instantiate the Cannonball Projectile
            Apply the calculated force
                Go back to WaitForTarget
