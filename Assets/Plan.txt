1: Get Vector Position for the target
    This will simplify the calculations as it would require more
    to calculate force at a spawning point 
2: Calculate force required to launch projectile to coordinates
    Normalize the vector. Calculate force (projectile motion)
    Normalize the x and z axes, Then use the 2D calculation
3: Quaternion rotate the cannon to direction of force
    Create a quaternion to represent our desired rotation.
    Use unity physics to apply the rotation
4: Spawn Projectile and Apply force.
    The projectile will use trigger collision to pass through objects.
    Must have a rigidbody to simulate gravity

Note: we can perform the calculation using the Physics engine, 
        then use unity physics to take the calculations and 
        apply the rotation and force.
